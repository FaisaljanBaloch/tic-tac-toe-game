# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java
A day, I planned to work on project which should be interested as well as challenging. So I came to a video by [@kunalstw](https://twitter.com/kunalstwt) about a TicTacToe game built with Java in 15 minutes. I became interested to develop its enhanced version with new features that should bring some challenges and be amusing.
