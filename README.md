# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple but a challenging game. There are many implementations of the game on App Stores and GitHub. So, creating a new one won't be a good idea, will it?
Not at all! But the main reason to develop this project was to enhance the game with new features and bring some challenges as well.

## Goal

I will be implementing the game with three releases.
1) **Tic-Tac-Toe Command-Line** - user will be able to run the game on their terminal or command-line.
2) **Tic-Tac-Toe GUI - a graphical** version of the game will be available to the users with a user-friendly interface that they can run on their computers.
3) **Tic-Tac-Toe Multi-Player** - an advanced version of the game where user will play the game using their friends and family on a local network.
